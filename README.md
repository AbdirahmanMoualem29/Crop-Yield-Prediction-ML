# Crop-Yield-Prediction-ML
A machine learning project focused on predicting crop yields based on various environmental and soil factors.

## Overview
With the unpredictable nature of climate change and its impact on agriculture, predicting crop yield has become crucial for farmers and stakeholders in the agriculture sector. This project aims to utilize historical data encompassing weather conditions, soil quality, and agricultural practices to forecast the potential yield for specific crops.

## Data Description
Our dataset includes:

- **Weather Data**: Historical records of temperature, rainfall, humidity, and sunshine hours.
- **Soil Data**: Information on pH level, organic carbon content, phosphorus, potassium, and more.
- **Agricultural Practices Data**: Details about fertilizer usage (type and quantity), pesticide usage, planting density, and crop rotation history.
- **Historical Yield Data**: Past yields of the crop, serving as our target variable.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand patterns, correlations, and distributions.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Crafting new features and selecting the most relevant ones for model training.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Utilizing regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees to predict crop yield. Performance will be measured using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R^2 score.
